## Personal Statement
My meticulous attention to detail and dedication to problem solving enables me to produce work to a high standard. On a daily basis I use my vast experience, communication skills and knowledge of cloud and computer application packages to carry out work efficiently and to meet deadlines. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to develop my skills and began an intensive 12-week AWS-reStart course with TechTalent Academy. I pride myself on getting to know a client and finding a best fit solution and I am comfortable working in a team environment or remotely.
